## python-engine Directory Audit

### 1. `python-engine/Dockerfile`
**Purpose:**
- Defines the container build process for the Python engine microservice, including base image, dependency installation, and execution entry point.

**Issues:**
- No explicit non-root user for runtime security.
- No HEALTHCHECK instruction for container monitoring.
- No multi-stage build (could optimize image size).

**Code Quality:**
- Follows standard Python Dockerfile conventions.
- Uses requirements.txt for dependency management.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Add a non-root user for production.
- Add a HEALTHCHECK instruction.
- Consider multi-stage builds for smaller images.

---

### 2. `python-engine/README.md`
**Purpose:**
- Provides documentation and usage instructions for the Python engine microservice.

**Issues:**
- Content not yet reviewed (please provide content if available).
- Ensure documentation covers setup, endpoints, configuration, and troubleshooting.

**Code Quality:**
- README present, which is good practice.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Ensure documentation is comprehensive and up to date.
- Add examples for API usage and error handling.

---

### 3. `python-engine/main.py`
**Purpose:**
- Main application file for the Python engine, likely implementing the FastAPI service for risk assessment and behavioral nudges.

**Issues:**
- Content not yet reviewed (please provide content if available).
- Ensure proper error handling, input validation, and logging are implemented.

**Code Quality:**
- Follows standard Python service entrypoint conventions.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Ensure code is modular and well-documented.
- Add comprehensive tests for endpoints and core logic.

---

### 4. `python-engine/requirements.txt`
**Purpose:**
- Lists all Python dependencies required for the engine service, ensuring reproducible environments.

**Issues:**
- Content not yet reviewed (please provide content if available).
- Check for outdated or vulnerable dependencies.

**Code Quality:**
- Standard practice for Python dependency management.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Regularly update and audit dependencies for security.
- Pin versions to avoid unexpected upgrades.
