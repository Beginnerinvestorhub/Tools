[Redis Cache (Redis Cloud)]   [Database (Postgres / investment_hub_db)]                                                      1️⃣ Frontend (Vercel)
Handles UI: dashboards, portfolio views, gamification, education modules.
Talks to backend only.
Uses Firebase for authentication and user management:
Sign up / login / user profile
Firebase SDK handles auth tokens → backend verifies JWT if needed
1️⃣ Frontend (Vercel)
Handles UI: dashboards, portfolio views, gamification, education modules.
Talks to backend only.
Uses Firebase for authentication and user management:
Sign up / login / user profile
Firebase SDK handles auth tokens → backend verifies JWT if needed
2️⃣ Backend (Render, Node.js)
Exposes REST/GraphQL endpoints for frontend.
Responsibilities:
Authenticate users (via Firebase JWT verification)
Route calls to Python engine for calculations and AI nudges
Aggregate portfolio and risk assessment data
Cache frequent results in Redis for speed
Persist user data in Postgres3️⃣ Python Engine (Render, FastAPI)
Responsible for heavy computation / financial logic / AI:
Portfolio calculations
Risk assessments
Gamification scoring
Behavioral nudges (AI + logic)
Educational content delivery
Backend calls Python engine via HTTP (internal URL inside Render is fine).
Python engine may also use Redis for caching calculation results or AI model predictions.4️⃣ Redis Cache
Stores frequently accessed data:
Computed dashboards
Gamification scores
AI nudges per user
Expensive API responses from Python engine
Only backend / Python engine should connect to Redis. Frontend should never connect directly.
5️⃣ Database
Stores persistent user info (not in Firebase):
Portfolio data
User settings for gamification / nudges
Historical results from Python engine calculations
6️⃣ Flow Example: Portfolio Dashboard
User logs in via Firebase → frontend receives JWT.
Frontend requests /api/portfolio from backend → sends JWT.
Backend verifies JWT, queries Redis cache for fast result.
If cache miss → backend calls Python engine for calculations.
Python engine calculates, stores results in Redis, returns to backend.
Backend returns structured data to frontend.
7️⃣ AI Behavioral Nudges
Python engine runs models using OpenAI/Anthropic API keys.
Nudges calculated per user, stored in Redis.
Backend serves these to frontend for real-time feedback or gamified alerts.
Security & Network Notes
Frontend → Backend: Use HTTPS + CORS (ALLOWED_ORIGINS)
Backend → Redis/Python engine: Internal Render networking, no IP allowlist needed if all on Render
Redis Cloud / External Redis: Must whitelist Render outbound IPs if plan requires it.
