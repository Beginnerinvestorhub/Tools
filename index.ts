/**
 * @fileoverview This file serves as the central export for all shared API types.
 * As you define new types for request payloads, responses, or shared models,
 * export them from this file.
 *
 * This allows both the frontend and backend to import types from a single,
 * consistent source: `@beginner-investor-hub/api-types`.
 *
 * Example:
 * export * from './user-types';
 * export * from './portfolio-types';
